# ExtensionRCodeForANM201
Extension syllabus created to be complementary to the basic code taught in ANM201 Ecophysiology course, in which I am a tutor. Originally delievered to the students in slightly different format (which is why there's a mismatch between the data file names in code vs as uploaded here).

## Teaching Themes
* Week 1: Navigating R Studio, basic commands, cheat-sheet for ANM201 tasks
    - [R Markdown](https://github.com/OakAlice/ExtensionRCodeForANM201/blob/main/ANM201_R_Cheatsheet.Rmd) and [html sheet](https://github.com/OakAlice/ExtensionRCodeForANM201/blob/main/ANM201%20R%20Cheat%20Sheet.html).
* Week 2 - Week 6: In progress (didn't come up with the idea for extension code until week 7 lol)
* Week 7: Developing custom ggplot themes, multi-panel plots, and using functions to plot 
    - [Code](https://github.com/OakAlice/ExtensionRCodeForANM201/blob/main/Week7_extension_code.R)
    - [Data](https://github.com/OakAlice/ExtensionRCodeForANM201/blob/main/Week7_data.csv)
* Week 8: Introduction to R Markdown for automated report writing
    - [Code](https://github.com/OakAlice/ExtensionRCodeForANM201/blob/main/Week8_extension_code.Rmd)
    - [Data (same as week 7)](https://github.com/OakAlice/ExtensionRCodeForANM201/blob/main/Week7_data.csv)
    - [Word doc output](https://github.com/OakAlice/ExtensionRCodeForANM201/blob/main/Week8_extension_code_output.docx)
* Week 9: Data wrangling unstructured files
    - [Code](https://github.com/OakAlice/ExtensionRCodeForANM201/blob/main/Week9_extension_code.R)
    - [Data](https://github.com/OakAlice/ExtensionRCodeForANM201/blob/main/Week9_data.txt)
